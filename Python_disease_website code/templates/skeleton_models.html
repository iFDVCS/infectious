                    <p>We used different models to cover the propagation of a given pathogen.</p>
                    <p><span class="SIR">THE SIR MODEL: </span> In epidemiology, the SIR model is used to study many infectious diseases such as mumps, rubella.. It is important to note that this model does not work with all  the diseases.
					The model is also used by researchers and health officials to explain the increase and decrease in people needing medical care for a certain disease during an epidemic. 
					One of the most basic procedures in the modelling of diseases is to use a compartmental model in which the population is divided into different groups. For the case of the SIR model, 
					it permits to compute the amount of susceptible (S) infected (I) and recovered (R) people in a population. It is also used to explain the change in the number of people needing medical attention during an epidemic.</p>
					<p><span class="SIS">THE SIS MODEL: </span> The SIS model can be easily derived from the SIR model by simply considering that the individuals recover with no immunity to the disease, that is, individuals are immediately 
					susceptible once they have recovered.</p>
