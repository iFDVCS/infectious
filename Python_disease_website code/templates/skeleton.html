					<!-- Main text part -->
                    <p>The establishment and spread of infectious diseases is a complex phenomenon with many interacting factors, 
					e.g., the environment with which the pathogen and hosts are situated in, the population(s) it is exposed to, 
					and the intra- and inter-dynamics of the population it is exposed to. The role of mathematical epidemiology 
					is to model the establishment and spread of pathogens. A predominant method of doing so, is to use the notion 
					of abstracting the population into compartments under certain assumptions, which represent their health status 
					with respect to the pathogen in the system. One of the cornerstone works to achieve success in this method was 
					done by Kermack and McKendrick in the early 1900s.</p>
                    <p>In our project, the aim is to build a computational simulation of diseases using the SIR and SIS model with Python. The
					simulation will be run through an application especially dedicated for it. Some parameters can be modified
					before the launch of the simulation in order to understand how the pathogens establish himself and spread in a given population.</p>
